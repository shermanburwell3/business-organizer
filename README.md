2. Download these files and keep the file structure intact.,

3. Log into postgresql through your terminal in the /db folder and run the following command: \i schema.sql (seeds.sql is there for testing and you do not need to use it)

4. Back in the root folder of this application (where you would find index.js) run "npm install" in the command line.

5. Run "node index.js" in the command line to run the application

## Usage
